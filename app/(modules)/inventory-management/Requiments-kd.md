## üîÑ Integration with Invoice (Payment Module)

- When a user generates an invoice:
  - Stock is deducted using FIFO method.
  - Profit is calculated using the purchase price from the stock batch.
  - Invoice line items will include productId, quantity, rate, tax, and profit.
- Stock deduction logic:
  - On invoice submit, a webhook or internal event triggers stock deduction.
  - The system fetches required product data and available stock batches.
  - Deduction occurs from oldest stock batch first (FIFO).
- Profit data and tax breakdown can be shown on the invoice preview.
- A flag in the user‚Äôs subscription plan will control whether inventory features are enabled during invoice creation.

> ‚ùó If the Inventory Module is **not purchased**, invoice generation won‚Äôt deduct stock or calculate profit.
